Todo:

- instead of download the video (in google video analyzer) buffer it

- We have to find a better way of finding similar songs. Lastfm isnt good enough

- Tikapi isnt a good api for tiktok. It doesnt work sometimes

- make it possible to curl the web.py class. make it possible for the other guys to create a javascript application around

- if Llama is open source, we could potentially switch from the openAI api to Llama to decrease the number of dependencies for this project

- improve the LLM response with prompt engineering
