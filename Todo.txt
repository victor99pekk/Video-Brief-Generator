Todo:


GOOGLEVIDEOANALYZER:
- instead of download the video (in google video analyzer) buffer it

LASTFM.PY: 
- We have to find a better way of finding similar songs. Lastfm isnt good enough. The apple music could be a good choice. i think you might have to pay for it though so could be good to check that it actually works

TIKAPI: 
- Tikapi isnt a good api for tiktok. It doesnt work sometimes

WEB.PY: 
- make it possible to curl the web.py class. make it possible for the other guys to create a javascript application around

LLM: 
- if Llama is open source, we could potentially switch from the openAI api to Llama to decrease the number of dependencies for this project
- improve the LLM response with prompt engineering.
